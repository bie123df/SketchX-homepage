The ultimate vision for **SketchX** is to understand how seeing can be explained by drawing. In other words, how a better understanding of human sketch data can be translated into insights on how human visual systems operate — and in turn, how such insights can benefit computer vision and cognitive science at large.

SketchX has been actively investigating all aspects of sketch research since 2012. The problems we study range from conventional tasks such as sketch recognition and sketch synthesis, to those we have pioneered, such as fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval and memory-aware forensic sketch analysis.

SketchX has established itself as a world-leading research lab on human sketch analytics. We continue to publish sketch-specific papers in top venues and have enjoyed many academic and commercial achievements, including:
- 🏆 *Best Science Paper Award* at **BMVC 2015**
- 🤝 Collaborations with **law enforcement agencies**
- 🛍️ Partnerships with **online retail platforms**

You can find more details about our publications and projects below.
